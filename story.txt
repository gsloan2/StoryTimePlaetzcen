I was going to the Flughafen driving my trusty Bratwurst down the Hauptstrasse when I noticed a Hund by the side of the road, 
I got off my Bratwurst and tripped onto a nearby Porsche after slipping on an apfelkuchen trying to help the Hund.
Upon seeing me slip on the apfelkuchen the Hund ran over and began eating the apfelkuchen with extreme fervor.
I took some Brot from the pocket of my Lederhose to try and get the Hund's attention, but it was more interested in the apfelkuchen.
So I walked to the Baeckerei to some Gebaeck, I entered through the doors when to my surprise I am in the local Ratskeller.
As I looked around the room was empty, I turned intent upon leaving when to my utter fear the door was Gesperrt.
I yelled and banged on the door and soon became Eingefroren as I felt a presence behind me.
To relax, I indulged in some Apfelkuchen inside of my Ratskeller
